                                We are a vibrant duo of students from Government Polytechnic, Pune, brought together by our interest in multimedia and animation. This site is an artistic platform where we can share the work we've created throughout our studies. In this space, we offer a variety of projects—ranging from animation, multimedia design, and interactive media—aimed at exploring the limits of what we can achieve as up-and-coming digital artists.

                                Our purpose is to raise awareness of the tremendous potential of students in multimedia and animation. With this site, we hope to present the projects we've worked on with our time, effort, and imagination, and share our development as digital artists. We hope to encourage other young artists to venture into the exciting realm of multimedia arts while building a community that is collaborative and supportive where learning and creativity thrive.
                    
                                Since we are students learning and trying everything, this website provides us an opportunity to log our journey and tell our tale through the art we produce. It is where we get to share our accomplishments, discuss our setbacks, and create a body of work to be able to present as we move towards being professionals in the field.

                                We are a duo of students studying towards degrees in Diploma in Computer Engineering. Our team consists of two memners out of which one concentrated on modeling, visual effects,and the other concentrated on interactive media and making the information more useful . Though our areas of emphasis vary, we  share an enthusiasm for creativity, narrative, and leveraging technology to make our visions a reality.
                    
                                We work together on collaborative projects, exchange methods, and critique each other's work, understanding that we are here to learn and develop. Our work represents not only our individual creativity but also our combined initiative to expand the limits of what is achievable in the digital art domain.
